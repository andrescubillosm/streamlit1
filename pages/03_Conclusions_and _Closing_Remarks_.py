#conclusions about data
with data_exp:
    st.title("Data")
    st.markdown("We are grateful in advance for the efforts made by the company Eficacia and its willingness to assist in the process. ")
    st.markdown("In conclusion, the data show problems with some stores in the collection or updating of information, particularly the small chains, which report products out of stock for longer periods of time than the other chains; the inventory data are necessary for analysis or the possible application of more complex models, but in this case they were discarded because it was not possible to relate them for various reasons.")
    st.markdown("There is a general imbalance in the data, but as mentioned above, it seems to be caused by the point at which the information is collected or reports inventories, prices and others, or by the fact that when data is processed (filtering, cleaning, organizing and joining), there are errors by specific city, by category and by chain, so it is suggested that processes be standardized and automated to eliminate this imbalance and make it easier to implement data management mechanisms.")



#why we used that model
with why_mod:
    st.title("Other model options")
    st.markdown("Although several types of models were analyzed for better forecasting, the quality of the data should be improved, starting with the collection process itself, so that in the future it will be easier to apply other model options in order to be more effective in forecasting possible inventory stockouts.  It would also be important to add an inventory dataset for each brand or chain of warehouses so that the information could be trained or contrasted with more complex models or algorithms.")
